"""
We have two rules.
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
a + b + c = p

We can then right the second equation, in terms of c.
This becomes. c = p - a - b

Then we substitute c into the 1st equation and we get:
a^2 + b^2 = (p - a - b)^2, which is equal to a^2 + b^2 = p^2 + a^2 + b^2 -2pa â€“ 2pb + 2ab

Then when we isolate b on the left side, we get
b = (p^2 - 2pa) / (2p-2a)

The equation on line 9 is just the factored form of the equation above.
