import fractions


# The smallest number n that is evenly divisible by every number in a set {k1, k2, ..., k_m}
# is also known as the lowest common multiple (LCM) of the set of numbers.
# The LCM of two natural numbers x and y is given by LCM(x, y) = x * y / GCD(x, y).
# When LCM is applied to a collection of numbers, it is commutative, associative, and idempotent.
# Hence LCM(k1, k2, ..., k_m) = LCM(...(LCM(LCM(k1, k2), k3)...), k_m).
