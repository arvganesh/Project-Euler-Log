# Computers are fast, so we can implement this solution by testing each number
# individually for primeness, instead of using the more efficient sieve of Eratosthenes.
# 
# The algorithm starts with an infinite stream of incrementing integers starting at 2,
# filters them to keep only the prime numbers, drops the first 10000 items,
# and finally returns the first item thereafter.
