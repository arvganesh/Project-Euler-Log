Learning: Python(2.7.6) , Java

Why I Switched To Python: I have found that python has more future applications, and many more useful libraries for developing in the future. Also, I would like to get into machine learning into the future, so python is better for that. I will leave all of my java solutions up, but will be solving the rest of them in python.
